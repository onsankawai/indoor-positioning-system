#Technical information about obtaining GPS reference point at an outdoor position

= Introduction =
As a start of the indoor-positioning system project, we decided to implement the indoor navigation by using motion sensor on a outdoor reference location.

This outdoor reference location would be obtained by using GPS on the Android device.

= Details =
Firstly we will need to have one pre-measured outdoor reference location just near the indoor area (for example: the entrance). As we cannot expect all users will enter the indoor area from that pre-measured outdoor reference location, we need to create a real-time calculated reference position based on the information we already have for the pre-measured location.

Let P,,ref,, be the pre-measured location, P,,user,, be the real-time calculated outdoor position for the user.

Using the latitude, longitude values obtained from GPS, we can calculate the distance and bearing between P,,ref,, and P,,user,,.

= Notes =
  # In our implementation, GPS (latitude, longitude) values are used in calculation ONLY IF the accuracy of the measurement is within 5 meters radius in a 68% confidence level.
